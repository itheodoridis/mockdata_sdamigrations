Mock data for sda migrations blog post and how to create them

## Data source

This is a set of scripts generated by ChatGPT-4 to assist in the comprehension of the code published at <https://github.com/itheodoridis/sdamigtrations>.

A relevant blog post is at <https://www.mythryll.com/?p=1976>

## Concept

I asked ChatGPT to assist in the anonymization of data manipulated by the code (or created by the code) so as to avoid publishing sensitive information. It proceeded in generating python scripts as well (I didn't ask for them) but I do think they are nice to study in case anyone needs to do something similar.

Faker is a python package that does exactly that, create fake data. Here is the documentation: <https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/>

You can find plenty of examples on Medium. Or you can ask ChatGPT. Or read these.

Have fun!
